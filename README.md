# I worked with a Formula 1 dataset and leveraged my skills in Tableau to create impactful dashboards. These dashboards provided comprehensive insights into key performance indicators, trends, and drivers within the Formula 1 racing industry.
# Using advanced features in Tableau, such as calculated fields, parameters, and filters, I developed interactive functionalities that allowed users to customize their exploration of the dataset. This enhanced user engagement and satisfaction, as they could delve deeper into the data and uncover valuable information.
# One of the key aspects of my work was designing interactive and user-friendly dashboards. These dashboards facilitated in-depth exploration of various metrics, such as the number of wins of drivers and countries, constructor points, driver qualifying positions, and the evolution of rivalries over the history of Formula1 racing. By presenting this information in a visually appealing and intuitive manner, I enabled users to easily navigate and extract meaningful insights from the data.
